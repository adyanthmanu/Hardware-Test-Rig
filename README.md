# Hardware-Test-Rig

Designed a six-degree-of-freedom stepper motor operated test rig to stress test computer vision system and test edge cases for pick and place operation. The goal of this project was to create a system that could stress test the newest software releases before deployment in production. 

The system comprises of two systems which are a combination of linear, rotation, and goniometer stepper motor stages interfaced with each other with custom designed interface plates. The stages are connected to an external control system and operated using a recipe.

The main constraints in the design of the system was making the system usable for all workpiece configurations for both pick and place and ensuring that the workpieces stayed within the field of view of the vision system.
